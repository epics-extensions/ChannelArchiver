/** \ingroup Storage
 * Reads data from storage, modified for plotting.
 *
 * The PlotReader is an implementaion of a DataReader
 * that returns data in a format suitable for plotting.
 * 
 * Beginning at the requested start time, the raw samples
 * within the next bin of 'delta' seconds are investigated, locating the
 * - initial,
 * - minimum,
 * - maximum,
 * - final value
 * within the bin as well as the last 'info' sample
 * like 'disconnected' or 'archive off'.
 * 
 * Those 5 samples are then sorted in time: Initial and final stay
 * as they are, but minimum, maximum and info samples might occur at
 * any time within the bin.
 * 
 * Finally, a 'unique' filter is applied:
 * If the initial and minimum sample are one and the same,
 * only the initial sample is returned. Similarly, the might only be a single
 * intial == mini == maxi == final sample, so only that single sample
 * is returned.
 * 
 * Then the next bin is investigated.
 * 
 * Note that there is no indication which value we're currently
 * returning: The first call to find() will investigate the current
 * bin and return the inital value. The following call to next() might
 * return the minumum within the bin, then the maximum and so on.
 *
 * This is meant to feed a plotting tool, one that simply draws a line
 * from sample to sample, with the intention of showing an envelope of the
 * raw data, resulting in significant data reduction.
